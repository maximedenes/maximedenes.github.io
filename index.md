### Coq
Coq is a fascinating piece of open-source software, that makes it possible to
prove the correctness of programs or mechanically formalize the proof of
mathematical theorems. [Have a look at Coq's website](https://coq.inria.fr).

### The Coq Consortium
I work on improving and promoting the Coq proof assistant, and on building a
Consortium of academic and industrial users of Coq. If you want to know more,
don't hesitate to [contact me](/contact).

### Cloud computing
Cloud computing is a key technology to build scalable IT systems and help
organizations focus on their core business. It is also a challenging area,
because it intersects with many research domains (distributed computing,
networks, virtualization, security, etc) and induces deep changes in economical
models and organizations. In these areas, I am especially interested in bridging
gaps in the French and European ecosystems between research, industry and public
administrations.

### TousAntiCovid
I am involved as CTO in the TousAntiCovid project, the application developed for
the French government to help fight against Covid-19.

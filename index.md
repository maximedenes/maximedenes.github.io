### Coq

Coq is a fascinating piece of open-source software, that makes it possible to
prove the correctness of programs or mechanically formalize the proof of
mathematical theorems. [Have a look at Coq's website](https://coq.inria.fr).

### The Coq Consortium
A Consortium of academic and industrial users of Coq is being created inside the
Inria Foundation. If you want to know more, don't hesitate to
[contact me](/contact).
